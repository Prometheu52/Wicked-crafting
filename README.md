## Usage
***
Run the AHK scritp with the AHK runtime
 - Basicly if you have AutoHotkey installed, you just double click it. It should create a hidden tray icon with the AHK logo. That means it is running

#### Ingame: 

 - Press Ctrl + 1 to bring up the GUI
 - In the GUI the "Source" fields are the starting point (usually the shotgun)
 - The "Ending" is the weapon you wnat to have the trait
 - The Inputbox at the bottom is where you put in characters to move the ingame menu

## Example:
***
The Auto Shotgun Rifle
Source row: 1
Source col: 1

Ending row: 2
Ending col: 1

Input field: A

After inputing these press OK

Navigate where the shotgun is in at the Enclave
Then press F2 to begin


#### Important

The script is not sucessful at 100% of the time. Limiting framerate or your connection is definitly helpful!

Also, I have only tested it on a 2k display. In theory it should work on any display but without testing I can not be sure!
